A file system inspired by the minix file system

Organisation:
  * superblock | bitmap for inode | inode zone | bitmap for data blocks | data block zone
  * bit map based inode and data block allocation
  * blocks for inodes and data are separated
  * zones are areas containing inodes and data blocks respectively
  * hierarchal file system with directories and files
